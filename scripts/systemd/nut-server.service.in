# A busy server can be monitoring a lot of devices as well as replying
# to many clients. The "infinity" definition is actually capped by OS
# settings and hardcoded defaults; typically can be 65535+ nowadays.
# On 64-bit distros this can well be set into hundreds of thousands
# as well (though note each connnection has a CPU and RAM overhead
# so one can strike physical limits upon deployment and/or bring the
# poorly sized system to a crawl, or worse). On a running system you
# can check /proc/$MAINPID/limits for active ulimits of the process.
